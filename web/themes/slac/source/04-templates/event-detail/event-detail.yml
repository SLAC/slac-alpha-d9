  <p>The launch and deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope went flawlessly. The telescope and instruments began cooling as soon as the sun shield was deployed, and once the temperature of the short wavelength detectors in NIRCam dropped below 120 K, the telescope alignment process began. This process will result in the instruments receiving diffraction-limited imagery from the telescope. In addition to commissioning the telescope, all four instruments will also be checked and performance measured to ensure that science observations can proceed smoothly later this year.</p>

  <p>Caterina Vernieri received her PhD from the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy,
  in 2014 and then moved to Chicago for a postdoctoral fellowship at the Fermi National
  Accelerator Laboratory. She joined SLAC in 2018 as a Panofsky Fellow. Throughout this time,
  she has been devoted to studying the Higgs boson using data from the LHC.
  She co-led the group in the CMS experiment studying the Higgs decay to b quarks at the time
  that this important decay process was finally discovered in the data. Here at SLAC, Caterina
  is working with the rival ATLAS experiment at the LHC. She is responsible for the construction
  of the new ATLAS Pixel Inner Tracker detector, a giant camera that will snap pictures at the
  much higher data rates expected from the planned upgrade of the LHC. She is also co-convener
  of the group on Higgs boson properties in the current national study of the future of particle physics.</p>
