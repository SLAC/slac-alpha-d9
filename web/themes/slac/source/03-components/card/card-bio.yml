  <p>Sands was instrumental in the construction and early operation of the laboratory. He helped design the SPEAR storage ring and wrote a monograph on electron storage rings. Sands was the first to demonstrate the importance of quantum effects in electron accelerators. He proposed a high-energy proton synchrotron using injection from a booster, and co-authored The Feynman Lectures on Physics.</p>
