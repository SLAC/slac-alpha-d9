  <p>The <a href="#">linear accelerator (linac)</a>, the longest modern building on Earth.
  The building above ground, nearly 2 miles long, houses klystrons that generate
  powerful microwaves. Below ground, these waves accelerate electrons to nearly
  the speed of light. Today the accelerator is divided into three sections that
  generate high-energy electrons for three facilities: the Linac Coherent Light
  Source (LCLS);  LCLS-II, an upgrade to LCLS now under construction; and the
  Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET).</p>
